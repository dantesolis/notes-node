  Just in case you stumble upon one of this `label`(s) around the project. This is what they do; this is how I usually keep track of the things I still need to do, or things I'd like to ask for help and/or haven't been able to fix.

  - [x] [TODO]: things to do
	- [x] [ASK]: things to ask about
  - [x] [FIXME]: fix me or look for a better idea
  - [x] [UNCOMMENT]: Usually done for hacks
